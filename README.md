# CreditCardFraudDetectionProject

Today's world has changed in terms of how businesses operate. As a result, 
there is a quick transition to digital transactions. Our approach to financial 
transactions has changed as a result of the accessibility and convenience provided by 
online payment systems, mobile banking apps, and e-commerce platforms. While 
there are definitely many benefits to this change, there are also new risks and 
problems that need to be managed to ensure safe and effective digital transactions. 
One of those problems is verifying whether the transactions that has been or will be 
made is authentic or otherwise. Nowadays, even if the transaction page is legit, 
sometimes there are malicious transactions that are hidden behind it making the 
transaction to be a fraud overall.

Therefore, we as a group have decided to use the data that has been obtained 
in Kaggle and make a Digital Transaction Checker. This model, will identify if a 
transaction is fraud based on the type of transaction, the amount that is used in 
transaction, the account holderâ€™s original and new balance that will occur after the 
transaction. If there are any abnormalities in any of the variables listed based on the 
data that we have provided to it, the AI will prompt the transaction to be a fraud 
transaction.

The data that we have chosen can be obtained through kaggle.
